This blog post highlights the new security features that have been included in WildFly 19.

== Support for MicroProfile JWT 1.1

Support has been added for the https://microprofile.io/project/eclipse/microprofile-jwt-auth[Eclipse MicroProfile JWT RBAC]
1.1.1 specification with the addition of a new `microprofile-jwt-smallrye` subsystem. Traditionally, security for
deployments would depend on resources defined within the management model to access local or remote stores containing
the definitions of the identities. Now, with minimal configuration contained within a deployment, MicroProfile JWT
provides the ability for authenticated identities to be established from the contents of cryptographically signed JWT
tokens received with each request.

== Support for TLS 1.3

It is now possible to use TLS 1.3 with WildFly when running against JDK 11 or higher. However, there is an important
caveat to be aware of. If JDK 11 is in use and if there is a very large number of TLS 1.3 requests being made, it is
possible that a drop in performance (throughput and response time) will occur compared to when using TLS 1.2 with WildFly.
Simply upgrading to newer JDK versions should improve performance. For this reason, the use of TLS 1.3 is currently
disabled by default. It is recommended to test for performance degradation prior to enabling TLS 1.3 in a production
environment. Take a look at this https://wildfly-security.github.io/wildfly-elytron/blog/tls-13-with-wildfly/[blog post]
to learn how to enable TLS 1.3.

== Web Services Integration with Elytron

Elytron already provides an API and a configuration file that can be used to configure client side security for outgoing
calls. It is now possible to use this Elytron client configuration with Web Services deployments.

== Resolution of System Properties in Permission Files

It is now possible to enable/disable the resolution of system properties in the permissions.xml and jboss-permissions.xml
files. More details can be found https://github.com/wildfly/wildfly/blob/master/docs/src/main/asciidoc/_admin-guide/subsystem-configuration/EE_Application_Deployment_Configuration.adoc#jboss-descriptor-property-replacement[here].
