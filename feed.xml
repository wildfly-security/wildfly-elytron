                The case-principal-transformer quickstart demonstrates how to use a case-principal-transformer to adjust a principal to upper case when securing EJBs. Note, the quickstart is building from this post which more closely explains how to configure filesystem realms and SASL authentication to secure EJBs. An Overview of the Case Principal Transformer Principal...

                When using a standalone WildFly server, it is currently possible to manage your configuration file history using a git repository. While previously it was only possible to connect to HTTP git servers, it is now possible to establish a connection with SSH servers as well. In order to connect to...

                WildFly Elytron now supports authenticating users with the External HTTP mechanism. The External mechanism allows users to be authenticated with credentials established outside the server via the AJP protocol. This means if you have users authenticated by an Apache httpd server, these users can be forwarded to WildFly. This can...

                Intrusion Detection is the art of sensing when a system or network is being used inappropriately or without authorization. Without intrusion detection, an attacker can attempt attacks many times until an attack is finally successful. Intrusion detection allows for these attacks to be identified before a successful attack is likely...
