                The default algorithm used for the digest authentication mechanism is MD5. You can configure the WildFly server to also require or accept the SHA-256 and SHA-512-256 algorithms. This configuration can be specified in the mechanism-configuration attribute of both the http-authentication-factory and the sasl-authentication-factory: &lt;http-authentication-factory name="exampleHttpAuthFactory" security-domain="exampleSD" http-server-mechanism-factory="global"&gt; &lt;mechanism-configuration&gt; &lt;mechanism mechanism-name="DIGEST-SHA-256"&gt;...

                Sometimes, you need to access additional information about an authenticated user. As an example, you may want to know when they logged in, or what information they have on file. Traditionally, this type of information needed to be stored using security realm attributes associated with an identity. Now in WildFly...

            <description>
                Previously, any data in the filesystem realm was not verified, this meant that anyone with access to the identity files, could tamper with the data without any way of knowing. WildFly 27 adds support for filesystem integrity checking by adding signatures to identity files. This is done using a public-private...
