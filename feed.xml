                The ejb-mutual-tls example demonstrates how to use Elytron to secure EJBs with mutual TLS authentication. It also shows how to restrict access to EJBs, configuring a FileSystem realm protected by SASL authentication, and accessed using a credential store. This example focuses on the TLS configuration, so if you wish to...

                Any one who has experience with network hardware or console administration knows the Achilles' heel of CLI - limited visualization capability.

                Previously, any data in the filesystem realm was always stored unencrypted, this meant that anyone with access to the filesystem identity files could access the credentials, and attributes (such as assigned roles). Now encryption has been added via a SecretKey. An overview of the new attributes The filesystem realm now...

                Elytron client now provides a java security provider which can be used to register a JVM wide default SSLContext. When this provider is registered with high enough priority and the method SSLContext.getDefault() is called, the provider instantiates and returns an SSLContext based on an Elytron client configuration file. So all...
