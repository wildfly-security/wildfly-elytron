/**
 * A callback used to acquire credentials.  On the client side of an authentication mechanism, the callback handler is
 * required to supply a credential for use in outbound authentication.  On the server side, the callback handler is
 * required to supply a credential for use in inbound authentication, possibly for both verification as well as establishing
 * authentication parameters.
 * <p>
 * This callback must be handled if a default credential was not supplied.  The callback
 * handler is expected to provide a credential to this callback if one is not present.  If no credential is available,
 * {@code null} is set, and authentication may fail.  If an unsupported credential type is set, an exception is thrown.
